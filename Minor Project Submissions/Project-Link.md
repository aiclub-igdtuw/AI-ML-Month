**Findings/Result:**
1. What is the number of people who will be given a grace period of exactly 15 days?
  - 206
2. Find the maximum fine that can be levied by the bank in the period of 15 days.
  - Rs. 4999.56
3. Assuming that all people falling in the category of defaulters have not paid their EMI in the grace period, what is the total amount being generated as a part of fine.
  - Rs. 769100.7
4.  Use a suitable plot to show the difference in bank balance of the people who are not eligible for the grace period, and those who are.
  - Majority of eligble people are clustered above bank balance of 5K.  
  - Some of elgible people with bank balance less than 5000 are unemployed.
  - All non-eligible people have less than 5K of bank balance
  - People who are eligible for grace period, generally have higher bank balance as compared to those who are not.
5.  Find the difference in the median of the bank balance of the people who are eligible for grace period and the original value.
  - Rs. 1348.32
6. Use the suitable graph to show the changes in the annual income of those people who are eligible for grace period and those who are not.
  - For eligible people (Eligiblity = True) we get 2 peaks: first peak at Annual Salary = 225000 and second peak at Annual Salary = 475000
  - For non eligible people (Eligiblity = False), we only get 1 peak at Annual Salary = 450000
