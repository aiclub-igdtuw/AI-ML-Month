Answers / Conclusion
1. The number of people who will be given a grace period of exactly 15 days is len(data_gp)=5298

2. The maximum fine that can be levied by the bank in the period of 15 days by the people who are not eligible for grace period ie. people who are employed and
  bank balance <5k which is 
  data_Fine15['FINE_15'].max()= 1874.8350000000003
  
3. I have calculated the fine for the people who were give grace period of 15 days and has caused delay of a day as, it was not mentioned how much delay is there in the payment so I have considered for a day .After that I have calculate fine of a day for the person who are unemployed and given extra grace period and at last i have calculated the fine for 15 days for the person who were not given any grace period. So, The total amount being generated by the bank as a part of the fine is 
Total_Fine=Total_15+Total_gp+Total_unemp
Total_15=Total Fine for 15 days who were no given grace period
Total_gp=Total fine for a day who were given grace period
Total_unemp= Total fine for unemployed who were given extra grace period
Total_Fine=1427446.035 + 1538362.749 + 872441.052
        = 3838249.836
        
4. Conclusion
The people who was given grace period of 15 days has more bank Balance as compaired to the people who does'nt got grace period
ie:
data_g['BANK BALANCE']>data_Nogp['BANK BALANCE']

5.  difference in the median of the bank balance of those people who are eligible for grace period and the original value is
       diff= gp_med- orignal_med
           =10999.02-9883.61
       diff= 1115.400
7.  Conclusion
Viewing the plot of Annual salaries of people who are eligible for grace period and the people who are not eligible it is very difficuilt to conclude any statement as their is no fix pattern that is observed in both line plot and bar graph plot.
