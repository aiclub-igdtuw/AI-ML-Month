Conclusion: 
-> Since both the figures are exactly the same therefore, all the people who are defaulted are eligible for grace period as well (orange line).
-> The graph shows the value=0 for the interval where Annual Balance <10000
-> People who are eligible for grace period ie orange line are widespread across the whole graph, it shows that people with all kind of annual balance are defaulted and are eligible for grace period.
-> The count of people not defaulted and thus not eligible for grace period ie blue line is far more as compared to those who are defaulted and eligible for grace period ie orange line.
