The numcol increases with totalprod
The production of honey is highest in 2010 in US.
# *The total honey production inceases with production value.
# *There are cases where production value overshoots the total production in year 2010. 
# *Also,there are cases whereby total production is ahead of production is ahead of production quantity like in year 1998.
# The most prominent Honey production states of US are ND,CA,SD and the SC state of US has the lowest production of honey
It is observed that the variation of yield per Colony remains in the range of 80-120 the trend indicates that the average value of yield per colony was initially high but with the passage of years it declined
The total value of production has increased overtime the increasing demand has also add to the value of honey.
