RESULT: a)number of people who will be given a grace period of exactly 15 days are 206. All of these people are employed and hence their grac eperiod would not be               extended.
        b)Assuming that the question is asking about the fine received by the bank in first 15 days, therefore the fine will be received by a person who will not get any         grace period. The maximum fine will be given by the person with maximum bank balance which is Rs.2366.415
        c)The fine received by the bank in one day would be Rs.2373195.378. 
        d) Column graph is used since it makes it easy to visualize and compare data
