CONCLUSIONS:
The dataset shows that most of the variables in the dataset are quantitative while the state variable is found to be qualitative.
Also the table shows the count of null values and the datatypes.
Number of colonies have a high positive correlation with total production,stocks and value of production.
Yield per colony does not have a high correlation with any of the features.
Same happens in the case of priceperlb.
The overall trend of the honey production shows that the total production of honey declines the most in year 2007.
There is variation in production of honey with decrement along the years.
The highest production of honey is observed in year 1998.
In general, the total honey production increases with production value.
There are also some cases where production value overshoots the total production like in year 2010.
Further, there are cases whereby total production is ahead of production quantity like in year 1998.
The number of colonies generally show certain increment as well as decrement along the years from 1998 to 2008.
Moreover, it is possible that certain measures might have been taken which increased the average production and even became highest in year 2010.
It is observed that the variation of yield per colony remains in the range of 80 - 120.
The trend indicates that the average value of yield per colony was initially high but with the passage of years, it declined.
The most prominent honey production states of US are ND,CA,SD.
The SC state of US has the lowest production of honey.
The total value of production has increased over time.
The increasung demand has also added to the value of honey.
