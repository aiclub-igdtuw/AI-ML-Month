DATASET ANALYSIS OF "HONEY PRODUCTION IN USA"

a) 8 columns

b) 626 rows

ACCURACY : In some studies I could be 99% accurate while in some 70 to 80%

RESULT :

From all the data analysis I've done for honey production, I concluded that:

a) With passing years honey comb production is declining in USA.

b) And value of production is increasing as a result of declining production.

c) The number of colonies in USA by and large are neither increased nor decreased.

d) ND (abbreviation used) state of USA has the maximum number of colonies for honey production.

e) There can be many reasons for this decline in honey production such as:

   (i) Deforestation
   
   (ii) Forest encroachment
   
   (iii) Climate change
   
   (iv) Pollution
   
   (v) Loss of habitat by wildlife.
