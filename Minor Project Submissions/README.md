The analysis of Loan default prediction helped me to draw following analysis:
1-Bank system tends to gain security of repayment of loan by assessing the financial condition of the cutomers. Financial condition is assessed majorly through the bank balance of individual and their annual salary.
If the customers fails to fit in the income  bracket , he/she is denied the opportunity of a grace period .
2-In case of non repayment of loans, certain time is provided by banks so that cutomers repay their loan in that duration.
3-The extension of  grace period is dependent on the employment status of customer.
4-During the analysis, I could find that many customers failed to get grace period inspite of the fact they had fulfilled annual salary criteria.
This hapened because their current account balance wasnt sufficient.
