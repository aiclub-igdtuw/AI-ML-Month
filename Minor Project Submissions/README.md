Result: The findings of the given Data Visualization project are as follows:
        1. There is a great disparity between the bank balance of the people who have been granted a grace period and those who have not been granted a grace period.
        2. The policies of the bank have been made keeping in mind the economic bankground of all its costumers.
        3. The interest rate of 2.5% charged is quite feasible for all.
        4. The policy of giving a grace period of 15 days to the customers having a certain amount of funds in the bank encourages more people to invest in the bank.
