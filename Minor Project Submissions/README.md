1.We replace the null values if the number of null values is not very large. The mean of the numerical column data is used to replace null values when the data is normally distributed. Median is used if the data comprised of outliers. Mode is used when the data having more occurences of a particular value or more frequent value. But when the number of null values is very large then we delete the column. The same thing I have done while solving the problem.

2.Bar charts are good for comparisons, while line charts work better for trends. Scatter plot charts are good for relationships and distributions, but pie charts should be used only for simple compositions.

Conclusions drawn:

Most Undergoing Studies are in Phase 2 with only 2.77% studies in Phase 4

Most studies are recruiting indicating a need of skilled individuals

Hydroxychloroquine is most used Intervention

Most Studies involve (Adult, Older Adult) Population with very few studies focussed on Children

Most studies have 0-40k participants in the clinical trials

Most Studies follow observational and interventional methodology

Most Studies take place in USA and France.

Max Funding for these Clinical trials are done by 'Industries'. Some studies are funded by NIH and US-FEDs

Most Studies aim to be completed by 2020-2025
