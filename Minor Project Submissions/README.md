Result 1: 206 number of people will be given a grace period of exactly 15 days.
Result 2: 11944.44 is the maximum fine that can be levied by the bank in the period of 15 days.
Result 3: 34972758.9 is the total amount of fine generated by the bank.
Result 4: People with bank balance between (5000, 15000) are less likely to be defaulted and thus eligible for grace period as compared to people with bank balance in range of (15000, 30000)
Result 5: 1614.42 is the difference in the median of the Bank Balance of people eligible for Grace Period and people who aren't.
Result 6: People eligible for grace period (orange line) are widespread across the whole graph which means that persons with all kind of annual balance are defaulted and are eligible for grace period.

The frequency of people not defaulted and thus not eligible for grace period (blue line) is way more as compared to those who are defaulted and eligible for grace period(red line).
