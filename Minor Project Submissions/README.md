#Observations:- 
#THE QUANTITATIVE DATA ARE-
#1.numcol
#2.yieldpercol
#3.totalprod
#4.stocks
#5.priceperlb
#6.prodvalue
#7.year
#The state 'number of colonies' shows +ve correlation with stocks. When number of colonies increase, all will increase. Shows direct relation with stock price 

#MIXED TREND OF TOTAL PRODUCTION OF HONEY OVER YEARS
#It decreased from 1998 to 1999 and then incresed again decresed till 2002 ,then increased in 2003 and decresed in 2004 again incresed in 2005 and so on year 2010 has maximum honey production and minimum was in 2002

#NO BAR PLOT OBSERVED IN BETWEEN 'totalprod' and 'valueprod'. AND THERE IS NO SCATTER PLOT BETWEEN THEM.
#There is mixed trend between them.

#YIELD PER COLONY WAS MAXIMUM IN 2002 FOLLOWED BY 2005 AND 2001
#YIELD PER COLONY WAS MINIMUM IN 2007.
#Yield per col is increasing from 2010 to 2012 the state with max total prod is ND the state with min prod is SC there is increaing production value over years when total production is declining.
