**RESULT:**
+ This study is a randomized, double-blinded, multi-center clinical trial in child adults aged 15 months ~ 59 years. The purpose of this study is to add knowledge about the disease by human volunteers to find the right vaccine about the the disease. Almost 6000 entries were made each volunteer is provided with a unique ID which is NCT followed by an eight digit number.
+ There are several useful functions for detecting, removing, and replacing null values in Pandas DataFrame :
   fillna(),
    replace(),
    *  we use a function isnull() and notnull(). Both functions help in checking whether a value is NaN or not.
          *  In order to drop null values from a dataframe, we used dropna() function. This function drops Rows/Columns of datasets with Null values.
          *  In this covid dataset, I use the dropna() function for those columns which contain more than 95% null values.
+ Ques : Give reason why you think this is best plot for particular study: 
      *  Histogram is a common variation of column charts used to present distribution and relationships of a single variable over a set of categories.
      *  Column chart is best used to compare different values when specific values are important, and it is expected that users will look up and compare               individual values between each column.
        With column charts you could compare values for different categories or compare value changes over a period of time for a single category.
      *  A pie chart typically represents numbers in percentages, used to visualise a part to whole relationship or a composition. Pie charts are not meant to           compare individual sections to each other or to represent exact values.
Ques : What Age Bracket and Gender are these Studies considering?
Observations:
    *  Most Studies involve (Adult, Older Adult) Population.
    *  Only Child studies are very few.
    *  Most studies have taken data from All Genders.
    *  In (Adult) and (Child,Adult) Category there is significant number of Female patients considered for the studies.
++ CONCLUSION:
   * Most Undergoing Studies are in Phase 2 with only 2.77% studies in Phase 4
   * Most studies are recruiting indicating a need of skilled individuals
   * Hydroxychloroquine is most used Intervention
   * Most Studies involve (Adult, Older Adult) Population with very few studies focussed on Children
   * Most studies have 0-40k participants in the clinical trials
   * Most Studies follow observational
