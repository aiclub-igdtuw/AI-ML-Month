Major Project - **Employee Attrition**

Models selected :-
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Observations:

*Logistic Regression* is the best model as it has the highest accuracy which is 88.77% and the highest f1 score too.

We furthur observe that  Total Working Years, Relationship satisfaction, Hourly Rate all these are most significant variables in determining employee attrition. If the company mostly looks after these areas then there will be a lesser chance of losing an employee.
