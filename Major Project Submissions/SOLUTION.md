Ans.1 After performing necessary calculations in the jupyter notebook we get to know that Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel) and Support Vector Machine (RBF Kernel) models were the most suitable models for prediction of attrition.

Ans.3 After plotting the graph to study accuracy and f1 scores of these three models we get to know that logistic regression is the best model.

Ans.4 Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method which is used to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. It predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

Logistic regression is the best model because:
1) It has the best accuracy that is upto 86.62% .
2) It is neither overfitted nor under fitted where underfitted means that your model makes accurate, but initially gives incorrect predictions and Overfitting means that your model does not make accurate predictions.
3) It is also used to make a prediction about a categorical variable versus a continuous one.
4) It is used to predict the likelihood of an event. 

Ans.5 From the graph given in jupyter notebook ,We can clearly infer that job level, overtime and PerformanceRating are the main reasons for employee attrition. So company should try to improve these areas so as to reduce attrition.
