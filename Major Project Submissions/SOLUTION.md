We are taking three models of our choice which we see fit for our analysis which are:
RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER
A random forest (RF) classifier is an ensemble classifier that produces multiple decision trees, using a randomly selected subset of training samples and variables.

DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
Decision tree classifiers are supervised machine learning models. This means that they use prelabelled data in order to train an algorithm that can be used to make a prediction. Decision trees can also be used for regression problems.

KNN
KNN is a supervised ML algorithm. You train your data on a labeled piece of data and ask it to predict the label for an unlabeled point in supervised learning.

We have chosen the Random Forest Classifier model
After Seeing the Classification model we can see that the accuracy of prediction of Random Forest Classifier is more than Decision Tree Classifier and KNN.

So we came to conclusion that Random Forest Classifier is best model for prediction of diabetes. (Detailed information can be found in google colab link .)
