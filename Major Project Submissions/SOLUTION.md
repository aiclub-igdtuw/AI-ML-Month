Logistic Regresion

Logistic regression is Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems and can be used to classify the observations using different types of data and can easily determine the most effective variables used for the classification.
KNN

It is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique and is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.
In KNN, we can directly update the memory and perform the inference. Less sensitive to class imbalance: Suppose we have two classes and one class has significantly higher instances in the dataset than the others. KNN, unlike other ML algorithms, is least affected by such class imbalances.
Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique and is a good model if you want high performance with less need for interpretation.
It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
