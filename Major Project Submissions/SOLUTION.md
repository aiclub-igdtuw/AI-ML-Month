We have used three models :RandomForest Classifier, Logistic Regression and DecisionTree Classifier

DecisionTree Classifier model score : 1.0

f1_score: 0.35211267605633806

Training Accuracy_score: 1.0

Testing Accuracy_score: 0.7913832199546486

Logistic Regression

model score : 0.8901846452866861

f1_score: 0.5192307692307693

Training Accuracy_score: 0.8736637512147716

Testing Accuracy_score: 0.8866213151927438

RandomForest Classifier

model score : 0.9815354713313897

f1_score: 0.21686746987951805

Training Accuracy_score: 0.9815354713313897

Testing Accuracy_score: 0.8526077097505669

Considering all the factors, Logistic Regression is found to be the best model.
