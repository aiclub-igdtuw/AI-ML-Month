Question-3 Accuracy F1 Scores And Graphs
Accuracy score of Logistic Regression 75.32467532467533
Accuracy score of KNN 72.72727272727273
Accuracy score of Supply Vector Machine 77.27272727272727

F1 SCORE OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION 0.5777777777777777
F1 SCORE OF KNN 0.5333333333333333
F1 SCORE OF Supply Vector Machine 0.6153846153846154

By plotting we can conclude that Support Vector Machine has the highest f1 score.
We can conclude that Support Vector Machine model has the highest accuracy

Question-4 MODEL CHOSEN
SUPPLY VECTOR MACHINE is best model for our data set analysis.
