1) we performed the analysis of dataset and plotted various graphs
a. Attrition is most for people who have been less than 7 yrs with current manager
b. Attrition is most for people in researh and development department and then sales department
c. Attrition is most for males
d. Attrition is most for people who have been in current role for 4 years or 7 to 9 yrs
e. Attrition is most for people

2) we have chosen 3 models
a. Logistic regression
b. Random forest
c. KNN model

3) we plotted the confusion for testing and training dataset for all models

4) we plotted the accuracy and F1 score graph for all models 
a. we found that best accuracy was for Logistic Regression
b. the best f1 score was also for logistic regression

5) And by analyzing all the mathmatical computations we found that Logistic regression was the best model out of the three because of all the best statistatical results out of the three models

6) we chose 1 st three entries of dataset and predicted the result of attrition 
   all the three examples had been redicted correctly
