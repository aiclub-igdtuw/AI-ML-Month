RESULT : 
Accuracies of different models studied are given below:
*  [Logistic Regression] training data accuracy is : 0.876596
*  [Logistic Regression] test data accuracy is : 0.880952
*  [KNN] training data accuracy is : 0.880851
*  [KNN] test data accuracy is : 0.802721
*  [Random Forest] training data accuracy is : 1.000000
*  [Random Forest] test data accuracy is : 0.860544

On the basis of the analysis performed, we find that
*  Logistic regression comes out to be the best model.
*  followed by Random forest and KNeighborsClassifier(Knn)

Through the graph between accuracy and f1-score, it is observed that
*  Logistic regression has best accuracy and f1-score. 
*  followed by Random forest and KNeighborsClassifier(Knn)

We have chosen logistic regression model as the most accurate because it gives the best analysis of employee attrition.
This result may be used by organisation to understand the modifications they should do to make their workers stay.
