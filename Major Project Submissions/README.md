Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/source-based-news-classification


#Results:
Q1.Necessary Analysis on dataset were performed and following models were used for prediction of Fake News:
    1)Random Forest
    2)Decision Tree
    3)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Q2.Confusion Matrix was plotted for all the models and observations were recorded.
Q3.Accuracy and F1-score are obtained through the observations of Confusion Matrix.
Decision Tree is chosen as the most suitable model for predictions.
Q4.Decision Tree chosen over other models because:
1. Decision Tree model gave the most Accurate results with an accuracy of 98.8%.
2. Decision trees are one of the best forms of learning algorithms based on various learning methods.
3. They boost predictive models with accuracy, ease in interpretation, and stability.
4. The tools are also effective in fitting non-linear relationships since they can solve data-fitting challenges, such as regression and classifications.
5. Decision Trees are easy to read and interpret, easy to prepare and requires less data cleaning.
Q5.Accuracy observed from the examples.
